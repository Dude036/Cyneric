Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers stationed there-or else have a very good explanation for their commander as to why they're out of proper uniform!</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such awkward, potentially fatal confrontations. The clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user's torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by high-ranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it's completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness's belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use a minimum of two: the one required for their current task, and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the first configuration is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Giving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time, and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made of metal.</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +2; <strong>Dex Cap</strong>+3; <strong>Check Penalty</strong>-1; <strong>Strength</strong> 12; <strong>Group</strong> plate</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Transform the clockwork disguise into any one current preset configuration of the user's choice.</p>",

      "Description": "<b>Traits:</b> uncommon, air, clockwork, water <b>AC:</b> +4 <b>Dex:</b> +1 <b>Check Penalty:</b> -4 <b>Speed Penalty:</b> -15 ft <b>Strength:</b> 18 <b>Bulk:</b> <p>The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for characters who prefer more protection. However, they also come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe. A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user to see what's going on in front of them.</p>\n<p>The suit's rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the user's range of movement and keeps them from moving faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the suit's back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system and separate air bladder; it's activated with a simple pull of a lever on the suit's belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder sprays the water out and propels the user short distances. This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface without walking to shore-it's too heavy to float on its own. Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back to the water's floor.</p>\n<p>The diving suit contains enough air for three hours of operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of air, drowning and suffocation rules begin to apply as normal. This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete. The diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the following stats:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong>+4; <strong>Dex Cap</strong>+1; <strong>Check Penalty</strong>-4; <strong>Speed Penalty</strong>-15 ft; <strong>Strength</strong> 18</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The diving suit shoots out a water jet that causes you to Swim 25 feet in a straight line.

It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while a number of animals belonging to species considered to be the eels' natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks. With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank. Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal, using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though it were midday.</p>\n<p>This device is an expression of a recent trend among certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their manors' interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as \"tacky\" and \"unrefined.\" If a noble in such company wishes not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race, and it's already proven popular with its target market.</p>\n<p>When active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use, and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled, though electric eels usually need feeding only once per day, and won't go after the prey if they're all full. While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed.</p>",

As long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature remains alive and can continue to think, even though its body is dead. Detachable modules that fit into the base of the cylinder allow the brain to see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker. So long as these are attached, the brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, though nothing within the cylinder compels it to do so if it is unwilling. It also retains its living alignment, and can use Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills. A standard brain cylinder has one skill at +15, one at +13, and two at +11, as chosen by the GM.</p>\n<p>The brain retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental ones. Mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes, as a brain preserved in this manner can live for centuries. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain dies and its soul finally moves on to the Boneyard. Restoring a brain in a brain cylinder to its former body can be done by any effect that restores life (and, in most cases, any capable of creating a new body, since the original is typically missing or long gone).</p>\n<p>Note that the level 6 brain cylinder presented represents a level 6 creature's brain. A less powerful or more powerful brain can be placed in a brain cylinder, which can affect the brain cylinder's Perception, mental ability scores, Will save, and skill modifiers (and can drastically alter the value of the brain cylinder), but the physical properties of the brain cylinder remain unchanged. Higher-level brain cylinders can be crafted, with resistances and weaknesses increasing as appropriate to their level. However, they always have low AC and HP and terrible Fortitude and Reflex saves for a creature of the brain cylinder's level.</p>\n<p>You can open a brain cylinder by taking three consecutive actions with the manipulate trait. If the brain cylinder contains a brain, the brain dies 3 rounds after it's removed or if the cylinder is left open for more than 10 minutes. You can transfer a brain from one brain cylinder to another with a DC 25 Medicine (expert) or Occultism (expert) check. This is a two-action activity with the manipulate trait. On a critical failure, the brain dies.</p>",

In reality, the prism refracts the four magical essences into the visible spectrum. A creature adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an Interact action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow from two input streams into the prism, where the prism combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until anyone reverses the prism's flow or finishes activating the prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is gently pushed back and out of the stream.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You alter and rearrange the facets of the essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality; vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane and occult magic both use mental essence). On a failure, you accidentally set the prism for some other quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The prism has only one input stream, and a creature is encased in magic in the input stream</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Over the course of the next hour, the creature in the input stream has its essences refracted through the prism, creating two cocoons of magic in the output streams that each contain a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is part of the original, separated from the rest based on the last quality set by the prism's first activation. For instance, if you set the prism to \"good\", one creature would have all the original creature's good aspects and the other would be the original creature's evil side. Unless you selected a physical quality, both new creatures look just like the original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower than the original, but if the original creature was strongly biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance, if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is 3 or more levels lower.

The new creature is an amalgam of the originals, with a new personality blended from both, and is usually 1 or 2 levels higher than the higher level of the original creatures unless the lower-level creature was much weaker. This activation also reverses the effect of the second activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Forcing the <em>essence prism</em> to combine two incompatible demigods destroys the prism, though it might also result in a new divinity.</p>",

The first, a delicate brush and a jar of extremely fine dust, is used to reveal fingerprints left behind by most humanoid creatures. The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces. When you use the kit to determine whether or not creatures left behind a fingerprint at a crime scene, the GM rolls a secret Thievery check against the Thievery DC of every creature capable of leaving prints that has interacted with the scene. On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.) At the GM's discretion, the print-leaving creature might get a bonus to its Thievery DC for taking special precautions. In other cases, finding a print might be impossible (such as if the creature was wearing gloves or if the location has been significantly compromised).</p>\n<p>The second part of the kit is a small sheaf of paper and a pad soaked in ink. By forcing a humanoid creature with fingerprints to roll a finger across the pad and then press it to the paper, you can obtain an image of the unique whorls in that creature's fingerprints. These can then be compared to any prints found at a crime scene. Successfully determining whether or not two prints match requires a DC 15 Perception check-the GM should roll this check secretly as well, since a failed check may result in false information.</p>",

A <em>Forgefather's seal</em> can be etched only onto armor that can bear two or more property runes, and it is so powerful that it takes the place of two property runes. While wearing armor etched with a <em>Forgefather's seal</em>, you gain fire resistance 40. You ignore the armor's check penalty and Speed penalty (if any); if the armor is light or medium, increase its item bonus to AC by 1.

The rune instantly restores the item to full Hit Points, even if the item was destroyed, using the effects of the remake spell, so long as the majority of the item is available for the repair. The seal can restore even magic items and artifacts of its level or lower.

The chosen creatures also gain a +4 status bonus to AC and saving throws, and fast healing 15 for 1 hour. You can use this ability to bring back to life a creature that requires a miracle spell or divine intervention to raise from the dead, as long as you choose no other creatures within 60 feet to recover. Once you use this activation, you are turned into a perfect statue made from stone or metal that depicts you in a glorious pose honoring your sacrifice, and you can never be restored.

The tube's twin prongs are placed into the user's nostrils, after which the user squeezes the rubber ball to activate the device, forcing the vapor into the user's body through their nose.

Nobody remembers who first invented the <em>holy steam ball</em>; they're likely lost to history because most initially thought it was a scam.

It consists of two flat metal squares, one larger than the other, connected by a tube of leather similar to that found on a bellows. The smaller square, which sits at the front of the device, has a small glass lens in the center of it. The larger square contains a specially treated metallic plate on the inside; its exterior also has both a small control stick connected via flexible wire, and a small metal tube attached to the top and pointing forward. The user presses a button on the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation, magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of the scene in front of the lens. The plate can then be removed, allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from appearing in the plate image. If creating a captured image of a living creature, it is equally important for that creature to remain still throughout the process, to avoid a ghostlike blurring of the final image</p>",

As a 10\u2011minute activity, you can imprint one extended memory onto a node: the contents of a specific simple book, for example, or the events of a recent adventure.

This grants a +2 item bonus to Recall Knowledge checks relating to details specifically occurring within the memory. What exactly qualifies is up to the GM's discretion, but a node shouldn't grant the benefits for most uses of a given skill. For example, a node dedicated to a book about trees found in the Mwangi Expanse would help with Recall Knowledge checks for such trees, but it wouldn't grant the benefits for all Nature checks to Recall Knowledge.</p>\n<p>A <em>memory palace</em> node can also store the text from a spellbook or magical tome, but these memories aren't a substitute for having the book in your possession. A wizard can't prepare spells from a <em>memory palace</em>, though they could use it as source material to try to Learn a Spell. However, since storing spells in a node would only benefit someone else who later discovers the memory palace, few choose to take such an action. The memories contained within the nodes aren't real, and thus don't cause harmful effects, even if the source of the memory was a mental danger. Many <em>memory palaces</em> have leftover memories from previous users-now long dead-imprinted on their various nodes.</p>",

Its outer shell is a brass cube half as tall as the average human that houses a series of flat metal \"blades\" in a circular arrangement. When placed on a flat surface, a creature within reach can Interact to flip the lever, turning the machine on. When the machine is active, the blades begin to spin rapidly, setting the air in the room into motion, which cools off the room's inhabitants. A front-mounted metal grate prevents anyone from coming into accidental contact with the spinning blades without impeding airflow.</p>\n<p>The nightbreeze machine was recently commissioned by Malduoni, Keeper of the First Law, leader of the nation of Rahadoum. He tasked the country's brightest inventors with creating devices that would, in his words, \"Ensure that no mortal need fear death from the desert heat.\" This machine was the first creation to come out of this consolidated engineering effort, but it won't be the last.</p>\n<p>A nightbreeze machine can affect an enclosed area of no more than 50 feet by 50 feet and has negligible effect when used in a larger enclosed area or outside. While active, it reduces the effects of severe heat by one step to mild heat, and reduces extreme heat to severe heat. A nightbreeze machine isn't powerful enough to reduce the effects of incredible heat, though fortunately such heat isn't found naturally in the deserts of Rahadoum. A nightbreeze machine runs for 8 hours, after which it must be wound in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete. The 8 hours of activity don't have to be consecutive.</p>",

      "Description": "<b>Traits:</b> artifact, evocation, magical, transmutation, rare<p>This bizarre machine is a complex arrangement of flasks, tubes, and other alchemical equipment. The <em>philosopher's extractor</em> is designed to create the ultimate alchemical concoctions. The extractor functions as an exceptional set of alchemist's tools, granting a +4 item bonus to Crafting checks related to alchemy. When using the extractor to Craft an alchemical item or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations, you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum damage with alchemist's fire or restoring the maximum number of Hit Points with an elixir of life. If the impeccable item has a duration, it lasts twice as long as normal. Finally, an impeccable alchemical item never has a drawback.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">T</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the extractor to produce an alchemical item of your level or lower whose formula you know. The extractor can create 56 levels' worth of items per day in this way. For example, the extractor could create two true elixirs of life (19th level) and two moderate elixirs of life (9th level), or eight comprehension elixirs (7th level), and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You take a sizable portion of a creature (at least two-thirds of its original mass) and filter it through the mechanisms of the extractor. After the end of the process, the philosopher's extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature's unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon's Breath Weapon, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature's DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature's physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal for mutagens and effects, you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying mutagens made from different creatures, you receive abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls, you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional concoction you drink.</p>\n<p>However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active transmogrifying mutagens you've consumed. On a failure, you fully transform into a member of the species of the latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost always go berserk from your change. The transformation may leave some amount of your personality and memories intact, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Simultaneously feeding the philosopher's extractor sizable portions of an aeon, angel, archon, azata, daemon, demon, devil, protean, and psychopomp, each of at least 14th level, along with a philosopher's stone causes the device to jam, overheat, and explode. Creatures within 60 feet of the explosion must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:55] save or become covered in an alchemical slurry that transforms them into a horrifying amalgam of at least two of the creatures used to destroy the machine.</p>",

      "Description": "<b>Traits:</b> artifact, divination, occult, rare<p>This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an anonymous author who sought to collect all parables, myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved\u2014by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death\u2014 though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose\u2014as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death.</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p>The Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied} unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Investigate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death).

That undead creature takes 5d6 positive damage (@Check[type:will|dc:27|basic:true] save) as portions of their incorporeal being are consumed in patches of seven equally spaced holes.

Eerie mists and indistinct whispers rise in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] around you, and clusters of seven perfectly spaced divots manifest in the ground, vegetation, and flesh of creatures in the emanation other than yourself and up to three creatures you designate at the time of activation. Creatures afflicted with these divots suffer from agonizing mental anguish in the form of crippling despair and take 4d6 mental damage (@Check[type:will|dc:27|basic:true] save). The mists, whispers, and strange divots fade away at the end of the round, but any creature that takes mental damage from the effect also takes a -1 penalty to saving throws against effects with the emotion trait for 1 minute.

If you die while affected by the Empty Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost. Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check\u2014 failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is consumed in this way does not travel to the River of Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only be restored to life via a 10th-level spell effect or ritual like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Wish]{Wish}</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Copies of The Whispering Reeds have no special protections and can be destroyed like any regular book, but doing so exposes the one who destroyed the book to the Empty Death.</p>",

      "Description": "<b>Traits:</b> artifact, conjuration, divination, magical, unique<p><strong>Usage</strong> Mounted in frame</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Void Mirror was created on a distant planet by a now\u2011extinct alien cult to aid in unlocking the secrets of the Dark Tapestry. It appears as a 5-foot-tall, 2-footwide mirror of dark glass. As long as it's unmounted in a frame, the Void Mirror functions only as a mirror, save that it always reflects the sky as if it were night, regardless of the time of day. When the Void Mirror is mounted in a frame, it instead serves as a window into space, displaying a star field in its glass rather than a reflection. This frame can be of any quality, but stouter frames help to prevent the frame's destruction and thus help to keep the Void Mirror functional.</p>\n<p>The view presented by the Void Mirror is any view of the night sky possible from its current physical location, regardless of time of day. Observations of the sky in this way add a +3 item bonus to Astronomy Lore or Perception checks made while using the mirror. The point of view can be shifted through hand gestures, causing the scene within the mirror to reorient in any direction desired.</p>\n<p>A character who peers into the starscape within the Void Mirror must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:41] save. On a <strong>failure</strong>, the character feels something looking back at them from the dark places between the stars. On a <strong>critical failure</strong>, this sensation causes the character to become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Frightened]{Frightened 1}. The character is then temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>By placing the Void Mirror in a specially-constructed frame, it can halt the ongoing transformation of a creature that has performed the apotheosis activation. Building such a frame is beyond the skill of low-level characters, as it requires an artisan with legendary proficiency in Crafting.</p>\n<p>The Void Mirror can be utilized in other ways, but before a character can activate these effects the occult methods to access these ritual-like effects must be Researched separately. Since the specific methods for these activations vary slightly from person to person, these methods can't be taught; each person who seeks to activate the Void Mirror in one of the following ways must complete their own research to unlock the artifact's secrets. Each requires a separate number of Occultism checks to Research, as detailed below for each activation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 20 Occultism (expert) checks when Researching (1 week per attempt)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The first activation ritual is known as \"Speak to the Void\" and allows the user to contact an intelligence in a distant part of the universe, provided the mirror shows that location (regardless of distance). This alien intelligence infuses the user's mind with answers, allowing the user to Recall Knowledge using Nature or Occultism as if they were legendary proficiency with the skill (including the +8 proficiency bonus). If this check fails, the character takes [[/r {10d6}[mental]]]{10d6 mental damage} (100 mental damage on a critical failure) as the imparted knowledge does more harm than good.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 30 Occultism (master) checks when Researching (1 month per attempt)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per year</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The second activation ritual is known as \"Call from the Void.\" The user performs a 1-hour-long rite before the Void Mirror, during which they indicate a type of aberration, beast, fungus, ooze, or plant creature that's an alien life form from the planet the user is currently located on. The target creature must be a level equal to or less than the user's level +4. As the rite ends, the user attempts an Occultism check against the target creature's Will DC.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is drawn across the universe to appear in a space adjacent to the Void Mirror. The creature's initial attitude toward the user is helpful, but this attitude can shift quickly if the creature realizes its goals and personality differs dramatically from the user's, or if the user makes a request of the creature that's against its nature. As long both the creature and the user are within 30 feet of the Void Mirror, the user can return the creature to its original location by Dismissing this activation. The creature can attempt a Will save against the user's Occultism DC to resist being returned; if it succeeds, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the creature is indifferent upon arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but the creature is hostile upon arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but magical feedback from the failed activation causes the user to become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stunned]{Stunned 3}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 7 days (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 40 Occultism (legendary) checks when Researching (1 year per attempt)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per century</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The third activation ritual is known as \"Become the Void\" and requires the user to continue performing the rite for 7 consecutive days (as if they were performing a multi-day ritual). If the user fails to perform this rite for one of these 7 consecutive days, they immediately suffer the critical failure effect below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The user's body, mind, and soul are infused with alien energies drawn from the Dark Tapestry, which transforms the user into an aberration of a level no higher than their current level +4. This new form could be an existing aberration or a unique one of the GM's creation. The user retains their memories and spellcasting ability (including any rituals they know) but becomes chaotic evil and loses all other abilities they possessed in their previous form.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the aberration the user transforms into can be of a level no higher than half the user's current level.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The user's attempt to change is a painful mistake that deals [[/r {10d6+40}[bludgeoning]]]{10d6+40 bludgeoning damage} as their body twists, bends and breaks. Ultimately, they are not transformed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The user is slain, but their body shifts and transforms into a brand new creature as the bodiless alien intelligence Tchekuth incubates within the user's flesh, mind and soul. This transformation takes another 7 days to complete but can be halted indefinitely if the Void Mirror is placed in a specially constructed frame aimed at the body's location (regardless of any solid object between the mirror and the body). Slowing or stopping this transformation via other means requires complex rituals or divine intervention, subject to the GM's whim. After 7 days, the body completes its transformation and Tchekuth rises once more as a physical threat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A creature that completes the apotheosis of Becoming the Void can destroy the Void Mirror by smashing it, though doing so also destroys the creature performing this action in a violent burst of occult energy.</p>",

In Alkenstar's hands, the musket was used to defend the burgeoning Grand Duchy from outside threats, including mutants of the Mana Wastes, Nexian constructs, and undead from Geb. After Ancil's death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree, not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar, as determined by the weapon's previous owner. Over time, the devotion and heroism of each successive wielder left a psychic imprint on the weapon, until it developed an intellect and drive of its own.</p>\n<p>A <em>duchy defender</em> is a powerful weapon with a rigid personality. It follows the laws of Alkenstar to the letter, and fights in defense of its nation. If these two priorities ever clash, a <em>duchy defender</em> prioritizes the protection of Alkenstar and its citizens over following the laws themselves, since laws can change, but the people will always need protecting.</p>\n<p>If you break the laws of Alkenstar, a <em>duchy defender</em> goes out of its way to call attention to you at inopportune times, such as when you're engaged in an illegal activity, and attempts to see you pay for your crimes, up to and including outing you to law enforcement and providing testimony against you in court. If a <em>duchy defender</em> is used unjustly against a citizen of Alkenstar, the weapon automatically misfires.</p>\n<p>If the weapon is removed from the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar without a reason that directly benefits the duchy, the <em>duchy defender</em> transports itself away, reappearing in the hands of a previous worthy owner, or elsewhere in Alkenstar if no such previous owner lives. In the hands of a worthy owner, a <em>duchy defender</em> is nearly impossible to steal, since it transports itself back to you at the first opportunity after someone takes it, and it grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to their Reflex DC to resist being disarmed of it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>duchy defender</em> focuses its will on a single target it can see and who it knows is guilty of committing a crime within Alkenstar's borders.

Traveling to an unknown location is draining; after doing so, the <em>duchy defender</em> can't transport itself anywhere for [[/r 1d4 #days]]{1d4 days}.</p>",

The ruby-eyed, leering devil's face that surrounds the barrel was intended to strike fear into the Countess's opponents-of which there were many. Countess Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional success in dueling circles and refused to name the weapon's creators for fear their works would fall into an opponent's hands. In the past decade, seven replicas of the Countess's famed pistol have arisen, each said to be crafted by the Countess's anonymous gunsmiths. That each of these weapon's wielders have quickly risen to become exceptional duelists in their own right has lent credence to their claims. Despite public pressure, wielders of these replicas have refused to square off against the Countess.</p>\n<p>Despite the weapon's beauty and utility, a <em>pact-bound pistol</em> is a cursed weapon and a physical manifestation of an infernal contract sworn between the bearer of the weapon and the Archdevil Mephistopheles. Each <em>pact-bound pistol</em> was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the weapon is an acceptance of the contract's terms and causes the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and can't be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the curse is removed.</p>\n<p>Whenever you attack a living creature with the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, text from the infernal contract is seared into your flesh, causing you to lose 1 Hit Point, or 2 Hit Points if the attack was a critical success. The text appears one sentence at a time, from the beginning to the end and is written in Infernal. When the contract is fully scribed (see below), you no longer lose Hit Points when you attack a living creature. These burned phrases heal over as scars which can't be removed while you are fused to the weapon, although they can be covered and disguised.</p>\n<p>Each time a creature dies within 1 hour of being damaged by a <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, that creature must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|name:Pact Bound Pistol] saving throw. On a failure, their soul is consigned to the Archdevil Mephistopheles; their soul immediately goes to Hell and they can't be returned to life through any means short of divine intervention, a heist, or a successful appeal in the courts of Hell; even powerful magic such as wish is insufficient. After you have consigned 9 souls to Mephistopheles in this way, the contract is fully scribed upon your flesh. You become immune to fire damage and the <em>pact-bound pistol</em> becomes a +2 striking greater fearsome dueling pistol. Your soul belongs to Mephistopheles and immediately goes to Hell when you die. You can't be returned to life through any means, even through the divine intervention of a deity.</p>\n<p>Failing to wield a <em>pact-bound pistol</em> is a breach of contract. Each day you go without firing the <em>pact-bound pistol</em> at a living creature, you must attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1}. If you are already stupefied, the value of your stupefied condition increases by 1, to a maximum of stupefied 4. While you're fused with the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, you can't reduce the value of your stupefied condition except by damaging a living creature with it. Whenever you damage a living creature with it, if you are suffering from the stupefied condition due to the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, your stupefied condition is removed.</p>",

If you prove charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the <em>sunken pistol</em> turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the <em>sunken pistol</em>, it would be wise to not accept water breathing from it, as it might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder to acquire it from your corpse. The <em>sunken pistol</em> can use the following activations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>sunken pistol</em> curses and insults a creature it can see, attempting an Intimidation check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Demoralize]{Demoralize} that creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>sunken pistol</em> casts water breathing on you as a 3rd-level arcane spell.
