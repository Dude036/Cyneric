   Crit Table
  </h1>
  <p>
   Hey everyone! So here's the crit tables we will be using for Atticus's upcoming campaign. If you have suggestions, please post them in the
   <code style="background-color: #bbb">
    #crit-happens
   </code>
   Discord channel and I'll add them here. Please notate which table, and which column you'd like it in. Atticus has overrule power, but I'll keep adding, so long as suggestions keep coming in. FYI, I will not be adding numbers for now, since there are only my suggestions. Once the campaign starts, I'll add numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here's how Criticals work.
  </p>
  <p>
   When making an attack against a creature, and you roll within the critical range of your weapon, it is considered a critical threat. Critical threats deal additional damage per their weapon properties. Spells by default deal double damage, unless the spell text specifies otherwise. To confirm a critical, roll to attack again. If your attack exceeds the AC of the target, you get an additional critical effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Critical fails works in a similair manner. Your critical fail range is equal to your critical threat range, but starting at 1 and increasing. For example, if a sword crit hits on a 19 and 20, it crit fails on a 1 and 2. If you roll within the critical fail range of your weapon, roll again to confirm. If your attack fails to hit the target's AC again, it is considered a critical fail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once you've confirmed a critical hit, or a critical failure, you'll roll another d20 to determine which column you will be in. Every table has a mild, moderate, and severe column. 1 to 3 is Extreme, 4 - 9 is Moderate, and 10 - 20 is Mild. Finally, once you know your column, roll percentile dice (1d100) to determine the row on the table.
  </p>
